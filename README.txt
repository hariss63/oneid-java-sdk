To use the API, you'll need a credential file called "api_key.json"

You can get this by running:

curl https://keychain.oneid.com/register > api_key.json

To install, we require Maven (http://maven.apache.org/):

git clone git@github.com:OneID/oneid-java-sdk.git

cd oneid-java-sdk

mvn clean install
